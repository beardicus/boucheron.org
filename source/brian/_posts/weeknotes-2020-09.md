Inspired by [Simon Willison](twitter.com/simonw/)'s regular [weeknotes posts](https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/), and [Stephanie Morillo](https://twitter.com/radiomorillo)'s book [The Developer's Guide
to Content Creation](https://www.developersguidetocontent.com/), I've decided to dust off this old blog. I come across a lot of interesting links and projects at my day job and for my hobbies, and it seems worthwhile to spend a few moments gathering them to share.

First off: [What (on Earth) are Weeknotes?](https://weeknot.es/what-on-earth-are-weeknotes-a81874c5cef9). Turns out "there are no rules to weeknoting", though many are work-oriented. For me, I'm just hoping to signal boost interestingness and have a low-friction outlet for all the stuff I'll never want to write 2000 words about.


## ESP32 Watches and Open Hardware

I've been seeing a boatload of [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview)-based watches lately (The ESP32 is a low-cost microcontroller with built-in wifi and bluetooth).

First up is the [LILYGO TTgo T-wristband](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50036&Id=1242&FId=t3:50036:3) which I foolishly bought and now it sits on my desk, demanding attention. The T-wristband is the same exact form factor as the [Xiaomi Mi Band](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DG3P996/), a pretty slick commercial product (which I also bought a while back), though the T-wristband has no pulse sensor and worse battery life. Nevertheless it has a cute 1 inch screen, a 9-axis motion sensor, and it comes with a tiny programmer/breakout board. You can program it from the Arduino IDE, but there's not much documentation and you should probably be comfortable with [reading the demo code](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGO-T-Wristband) if you're going to dive in.

I don't really enjoy big watches, so these wristbands are more my style... or so I thought! Then I saw the [M5StickC](https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/stick-c)! Look at that glorious orange wrist lump!

I've been enjoying [@mntmn](https://twitter.com/mntmn)'s ([mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@mntmn)) progress reports on his development of the [MNT Reform](https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/reform) open hardware laptop.

It's already sold out but this [BlackBerry Q10 keyboard breakout](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/bb-q10-keyboard-pmod/) module could enable some fun handheld projects.
