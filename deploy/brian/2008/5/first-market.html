<p>Last Friday was our first harvest day, in preparation for the
Ashfield Farmer&#8217;s Market Saturday morning. It was pretty exciting
to finally be able to snip some edible bits off of some of the
plants we&#8217;ve been staring at for more than a month now. We mostly
had salad mix and spinach from the beds in the greenhouse. I
remember preparing some of those beds my first weekend here, back
in April. It feels like everything is growing sooooo slooooowly,
but I think I just have unrealistic expectations. It sure is nice
though, to sit up in the barn loft and look at the fields, with
rows upon rows of thin green lines (some red and purple)&#8230; I can&#8217;t
wait until they&#8217;re all thick green&nbsp;lines.</p>

<p>We also pulled up some onions that had overwintered in the field
across the road. Their existence wasn&#8217;t really intentional: it was
a bed that had been lost to weeds last year and mowed down to
nothing before winter. But they came back, and upon pulling them up
they had some nice white bulbs attached. So we made up about 35
bunches of those, which involved cleaning off the gunky layers,
snipping the roots, bunching them up, and washing them off in a
bucket. A lot of labor, but worth it because nobody else had fresh
onions at the market. Rounding out the selection was bunches of
chives, a few bunches of tarragon, and that&#8217;s it. All of this was
packed up and ready for the <span class="caps">CSA</span> members to pick up at the market.
We don&#8217;t divvy things out into boxes and drop them off anywhere,
instead our members get a canvas bag with a pretty Sangha Farm logo
on it, and they just come to the market and fill it up. It
certainly makes things easier on us, and I think is good for the
customer, as they can pick and choose only the things they want
(although there is something to be said for being forced to try the
new fruits and vegetables you find in your <span class="caps">CSA</span>&nbsp;share).</p>

<p>In addition to our meager selection of produce, we had a ton of
vegetable starts to bring to the market. The van was quite full,
with multiple tiers of precariously stacked flats of delicate
plants. Luckily the market is only about one mile away. We got
there at seven and were just finishing setup by eight thirty when
the market opens. As of right now us interns don&#8217;t really have to
work the market, so after hanging around and helping out a little
bit, I wandered off and sat under a tree to write letters. It was a
beautiful day, and tons of people came out. The market is much
smaller than Rochester&#8217;s main public market, and much more social.
In the center of all the tents was a constant four hour meeting of
neighbors and friends (and dogs). A man in a bowler hat and bow tie
came and played cello for a bit. Another man brought two tiny
donkeys and walked them around while being followed by eager
donkey-petters (they were amazingly soft (the&nbsp;donkeys)).</p>
<p>After writing letters for a while, I wandered to the post office
and the hardware store, and got back in time to see the ice cream
truck pull up in front of the town green where the market is held.
It&#8217;s an old converted school bus, out of which is served locally
made organic ice cream. Of course I had to sample some, and indeed
the butter pecan was quite&nbsp;delicious.</p>
<p>Ooh! I forgot about the cheese. We finally got our license to make
and sell cheese. What an amazingly bureaucratic process that is.
I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t even really hear about half of it, but from what
I did hear it&#8217;s no wonder there are very few small-time dairies&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>But, we made it through all the hoops, and Maribeth cranked out as
much cheese as possible before the market. She had a sample tray
all set up and received many complements and sold out of everything
she made. That means there will be two more does joining us, and
the two does with kids still nursing will be separated at night so
we can steal the morning milk at least. More milk! Unfamiliar
teats!&nbsp;Yikes!</p>
