<p>I have been reprimanded for not posting enough, and for not taking
enough pictures of baby animals. One of those &#8220;problems&#8221; is easy to
remedy. As you may be noticing, this post is awash in photographs
of cute baby sheep and goats and even a bad puppy.&nbsp;Enjoy!</p>

<p>As far as writing more, I suppose I&#8217;ll have to just write about the
minute doings of my current life. I guess maybe that&#8217;s interesting.
Today, I drove a tractor. A tractor with a bucket thingy and
separate pedals for forward and reverse, and separate left and
right brakes. It seems like a really good idea to me, to have four
pedals available for maximizing your messing up&nbsp;potential.</p>
<p>I used the tractor to do two things: After we mucked out all the
stalls this morning, I had to scrape the bedding away from the barn
and scoop it into the big steamy pile of cow goo. I feel like the
bucket control lever could have a much more intuitive interface
(perhaps a scroll wheel or a trackpad?) but I managed to get the
hang of it just fine. In the afternoon I had to take water up to
the oxen, who are out on pasture finally (they were very happy to
be out of the barn, and I wish I had shot video of the terrifying
sight of a 1600 pound oxen jumping and bucking with glee whilst
stumbling down the hillside towards the tiny yet apparently
effective portable electric fencing). This involves filling a basin
and toting it up the hill in the tractor&#8217;s bucket, whilst not
spilling too much. I got it all the way up the hill, and dropped it
as I was setting it down inside the fence. Round two was more
successful, with the boys receiving not only fifteen gallons of
water, but also their surprisingly heavy mineral block for licking&nbsp;upon.</p>

<p>It only took two days for me to get zapped by the aforementioned
fencing. It felt similar to when I plugged in my Lite-Brite
incorrectly (read: while squeezing the prongs together to fit it in
the outlet), only this time no thoughts of turning into a robot
crossed my mind, and I find that terribly&nbsp;disappointing.</p>
