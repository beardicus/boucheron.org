<p>I had visitors last weekend. Somehow only one of them managed to
get photographed. Rachel drove to Rome, and hitched a ride the rest
of the way with my parents, who were on their way to Vermont to
meet up with other Volkswagen Bus weirdos. So they got in fairly
early on Friday, and we put her to work rather quickly after the
folks left. For some reason we were a little behind in the harvest.
Oh yeah&#8230; because a goat had a broken leg and there were vet
visits and such to worry about. So Rachel and I harvested together
whilst everybody else was off at the vet. We bunched up kale,
beets, carrots, and lots of herbs. Probably some other stuff I&#8217;ve
forgotten about as well. (Oh yeah! Two kinds of cucumbers and three&nbsp;squashies.)</p>
<p>So, it was nice to see her, and even though we couldn&#8217;t manage to
chit-chat while harvesting and counting bunches and such, it was a
nice plump weekend of activities. Too much walking to town and back
though&#8230; I was getting more tired on my days off than during the&nbsp;week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/2674880635/" title="Shelburne Falls Potholes by bert_m_b, on Flickr"><img alt="Shelburne Falls Potholes" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3055/2674880635_0acafb7a6a_z.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>We took a short ride to Shelburne Falls, and wandered around there
like touristy folk. There is a bridge of flowers that we walked
along, with Rachel telling me what they all were and me forgetting
them promptly. It was quite lovely, and I managed to take zero
pictures. We got a frozen hot chocolate at a cafe, and it was
delicious and not at all like a chocolate milkshake thank&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>The parents came back Sunday evening, and we went out to dinner at
a local bar, of which I didn&#8217;t get the impression of &#8220;fine
eatery&#8221;&#8230; but it was really quite good. I made everybody eat some
mussels. And the desserts were fantastic looking, so we were all
fatty-fats and pigged out. Then we came back and drank some beer
and played&nbsp;pitch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/2674899563/" title="Garlic Buggie by bert_m_b, on Flickr"><img alt="Garlic Buggie" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2674899563_274368c7ea_z.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>And then, everybody left me on Monday. Poo. Then it was back to the
same old. Wednesday was a little different though&#8230; we harvested
all the garlic. Not sure how much, we never did end up counting
bulbs. It was about fifty pounds of seed garlic though. So we
pulled it all up, laid it out, filled up a cart, dragged it to the
barn, bunched it up, and hung it on strings. It was kindof my first
blister-causing activity. My hands are a mess, which made it hard
to weed and trellis tomatoes&nbsp;today.</p>

<p>It smells rather delicious walking through the barn now&#8230; and of
course I&#8217;m making some hilarious vampire&nbsp;jokes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/2674908369/" title="Guinea Fowl, One Week by bert_m_b, on Flickr"><img alt="Guinea Fowl, One Week" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3134/2674908369_09b2d9e0e0_z.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The wee Guinea Fowl are one week closer to ugliness. Look at that
elongating neck! They&#8217;ve been moved inside with their surrogate
mother. Now they reside in an old playpen, and thankfully still
make only cute chick sounds. I anticipate they&#8217;ll be out and about
before they learn how to be more obnoxious. I wonder, will they act
somewhat more chickenish then the other Guineas? Will they all get
along? Probably not&#8230; they&#8217;re known for finding at least one of
their own to pick on and excommunicate. Heartless poultry. I think
I shall eat one of you after&nbsp;all.</p>
