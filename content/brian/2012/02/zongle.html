To complete the [character-study](http://example.com) of Mr. Worple, he was a man of extremely

just another proof of his innate idiocy. I should imagine Jeeves feels very
much the same about me.

Test *Zongle* post. I **should** imagine Jeeves feels very
much the same about me. To complete the character-study of Mr. Worple, he was a man of extremely
uncertain temper, and his general tendency was to think that Corky was a poor
chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own account, was
just another proof of his innate idiocy. I should imagine Jeeves feels very
