Back when I was a youngster, I was forced to spend many hours upon
a tractor, mowing acres upon acres of foolish lawn, huffing exhaust
and damaging my hearing all the while (thanks parents!). As I sat
on my buttocks for extended periods of time, I would often set my
mind to thinking upon different fantastical technologies one could
use to trim grass with less pain and more ease. Most of what I came
up with was nebulously defined at best, but it usually involved
laser beams.

Yes indeed. Obviously laser beams would, at the push of a button
(perhaps after turning a key or some other nuclear launch button
safety device), shoot out over your lawn at the specified height,
neatly snipping the tips of every blade in sight, perhaps even
incinerating the trimmings (if you're the bag-em-up type). I
envisioned this system as one you would install once, with the
beams and mirrors placed in all the right spots to get behind every
tree and down into every contour of the lawn. Ever afterwards, your
juvenile life would be free of toil and full of recreation and
joy.

I am now reminded of this technology every time we move the animals
and their portable electric fences. They each have their own
munching styles, but in general the combination of energized fences
and hungry hungry animals ensures a laser-like cut of grass...
every single blade right up to the fence line. When I move fence I
feel like I am setting up my childhood Lazer-Mow system, defining
the boundaries and coordinates within which the grass shall be
trimmed to my specifications. Up and down hills, over gullies,
around trees and rocks. Nothing fazes the herbivorous lawnmowing
machine.

Best of all, it's also fertilizing the soil, reseeding the pasture,
generating meat or milk or wool or oxen-power, the only noise is
some cute bleating or the occasional moo, and it's much less
odiferous than a tractor. It feels like a much better use of
technology, to gently guide nature with some solar powered fence
chargers and a roll of fence, instead of trying to dominate it
completely with hundreds of pounds of iron and gasoline and hours
of someone's precious time.
