Sorry for the delay... I arrived on the farm Tuesday and have been
rather busy since. I just got a chance to set up the internets last
night. I also haven't taken a ton of photos yet, I feel like a
tourist boob whipping out my camera at every single interesting
thing. I've certainly missed a lot of cute baby photo-ops thus far
(cute animal babies, that is). Just yesterday there was some
feeding of a newborn lamb in the house next to the fire. It was the
only one of five to survive, so a sad morning, but happy that this
one pulled through and got up on its wobbly too-big legs and is now
back in the barn nursing.

The area is beautiful, even when it's all melty and muddy. Last
night we got a dusting of snow, so it's back to a lovely winter
white, if you're into that sort of thing. Personally, I'm rather
done with winter and am looking forward to seeing this place put on
some fuzzy green pantaloons. We were working in the greenhouse
yesterday, and will do so again today. It was one-hundred degrees
in there when we opened the doors... rather nice to work in short
sleeves and sweat a bit, although my back is sore from preparing
the beds for planting greens.

We have to feed the fire in the greenhouse a couple of times a
night, and my shifts are gradually getting later and later as I am
less and less the new guy. I hope the nights warm up soon, so we
can all get uninterrupted sleep again. Even with the slumbertime
chores I'm finding it pretty easy to get up around six or so. That
might be because things wind down here around ten and I find it
hard to stay up much later than that. Certainly is a schedule
shift, and I'm struggling to figure out how to separate free-time
from work-time and how to relax and also get other personal
projects done. Today we're taking a wee break before going out to
work. Everybody is gone but Adam (the other intern) and I.

OK, it's almost the top of the hour, time to check on the
soon-to-be-mother sheep and get down to work. Expect more bland
stories and flaccid insight in the weeks to come!
