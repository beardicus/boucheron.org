<p>Well. I find myself missing the above pictured critters, as well as
the goats, oxen, yaks, and farm folk. I left the farm mid-August,
in order to get home and take care of some pressing matters. I
guess things were getting pretty routine by that point anyway, and
it made me itch to get home and start doing something&#8230; finding
some land, developing some freelance work, learning some
newly-important life skills, working on some different farms. I&#8217;m
not sure what I&#8217;ll have to blabber about on the blog now, but you
should be warned that some of it will probably be 1000% more nerdy
than before. We&#8217;ll&nbsp;see.</p>
<p>Right after I got home, Rachel and I zipped off to Maine to laze
about for a week at her parents&#8217; place. That certainly delayed my
settling-in phase here in Rochester, but made for a great
transition between two very different worlds. I still get up fairly
early, but I am creeping later and later each day, and I stay up
too late. I&#8217;ll have to work on that, as I enjoy getting up at six
and having the quiet morning to myself. Also, it is odd to have too
much free time and too little hard labor. I&#8217;ve contacted some local
farms and hopefully will find a place I can visit and work at
between my job and freelance and other pursuits&#8230; the garden just
doesn&#8217;t cut&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><img alt="Birthday Cake Fire" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2810083764.jpg" /></p>
<p>We happened to be in Maine on my birthday, and Rachel <span class="amp">&amp;</span> her sister
made me a yummy farm-themed cake. They managed to cover all the
important animals from the farm, except the yaks. There was even a
team of appropriately colored oxen, munching on the coconut and
frosting &#8220;grass&#8221;. I managed to milk the birthday event for almost a
full week&#8230; eating too much, drinking vast quantities of yummy
beer, and lazing about reading books and taking naps.&nbsp;Whee!</p>
<p><img alt="Birthday Brace Balloon" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2809268799.jpg" /></p>
<p>But now it&#8217;s back to reality-land. First on the to-do list was to
set up an office here at Rachel&#8217;s place, which I guess is now &#8220;our
place&#8221;. Having done that I am now ready to dive into some freelance
work, and have indeed already talked to the bike shop and started
some materials for next year&#8217;s Tour de New York (the first, I
suppose). Soon I will return to my prior job part-time as well, and
also try to work in some internships, with any luck. So maybe there
will soon be more variety here, instead of all these tiresome
pictures of farm animals! Who&nbsp;knows!</p></section>
