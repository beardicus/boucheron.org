	<section><p>Ack! It&#8217;s already Wednesday night and I haven&#8217;t written about last
week or this past weekend even! Even now, at nine o&#8217;clock, I feel
bad because my typing is probably keeping Adam up, and really I
would enjoy sleeping very much. We&#8217;ve shifted our schedule around,
so now I&#8217;m getting up at five thirty, eating breakfast and
attempting to slowly start the day, and then out and working by
seven. I guess that&#8217;s not crazy early. It feels it though,
especially when you have to milk in the evening and aren&#8217;t really
done working until eight thirty. I&#8217;ve taken to making lunch a quick
sandwich, so that I can sneak off and catch a little nap before we
get back to&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been planting like mad for the past week, and all of this
week. Onions onions onions leeks cabbage cabbage cabbage broccoli
and other stuff I readily forget. We had a little frost scare a few
nights ago, but it never materialized. The only vulnerable thing in
the fields was the zucchini, so those got covered up for the&nbsp;night.</p>
<p>Most of the things we&#8217;re planting were started in the greenhouse
last month. Radishes, beets, carrots, lettuce mixes, and a few
other things are all that have been directly sown. The seeder is a
mildly amusing little device that is filled with seed and run down
the beds as its wheels churn and it digs a trench, meters out seed,
fills the trench, and tamps it down. All of the rows I&#8217;ve done are
far from straight. Nobody else does much better, actually. The only
reason it matters is that it stinks when a hoe wont fit between the
two rows due to somebody&#8217;s sloppy&nbsp;driving.</p>

<p>I had a visitor last weekend. Rachel came out from Rochester
Thursday night via train. It was a rather nice visit, which we
started out by hand-weeding a bed of mesclun mix. That took most of
Friday actually. I milked Friday morning, just so my personal
photographer could record the event and prove that I&#8217;m on a farm
and learning&nbsp;things.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re finally settling into a semi-routine as far as moving all of
the animals is concerned. We moved the chicken coop a few days ago,
and for two or three days the hens weren&#8217;t really able to find
their way back at night. So that was a chore&#8230; waiting until they
were sleeping on a fence somewhere before grabbing them and putting
them into the coop. That has finally stopped. The girl goats are
being moved to new pasture every day&#8230; boy goats every few days.
The sheep are finally out for almost a week at a time. The oxen are
chewing on possibly five days of pasture per move, but are still
being punks and getting out of their fence too often. Time to up
the&nbsp;voltage.</p>

<p>Oh! I almost forgot&#8230; we got llamas last Sunday! Llamas have a
funny looking name, and are funny looking creatures. Everything
about them is weird and they scare me and they smell and I really
really dislike them. Llamas sure do spit when agitated. And perhaps
you think &#8220;Gee Brian. Getting spit on isn&#8217;t too terrible, is
it?&#8221;&#8230; and I say yes. Yes it is, because this is llama spit and
<span class="caps">LLAMAS</span> <span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;T <span class="caps">BRUSH</span> <span class="caps">THEIR</span> <span class="caps">TEETH</span>, <span class="caps">OK</span>? It is a foul substance that you
could only simulate by fermenting the essence of dog breath with a
touch of vomit and moldy&nbsp;sock.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d have photos here of said llamas, but I really don&#8217;t feel like
getting my camera all smelled up. Maybe I&#8217;ll risk it soon, just so
you can see the freak show yourselves. Until then&#8230; I require&nbsp;slumber.</p></section>
