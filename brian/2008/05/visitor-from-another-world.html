It&#x2019;s already Wednesday night and I haven&#x2019;t written about last week or this past weekend even! Even now, at nine o&#x2019;clock, I feel bad because my typing is probably keeping Adam up, and really I would enjoy sleeping very much. We&#x2019;ve shifted our schedule around, so now I&#x2019;m getting up at five thirty, eating breakfast and attempting to slowly start the day, and then out and working by seven. I guess that&#x2019;s not crazy early. It feels it though, especially when you have to milk in the evening and aren&#x2019;t really done working until eight thirty. I&#x2019;ve taken to making lunch a quick sandwich, so that I can sneak off and catch a little nap before we get back to work.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve been planting like mad for the past week, and all of this week. Onions onions onions leeks cabbage cabbage cabbage broccoli and other stuff I readily forget. We had a little frost scare a few nights ago, but it never materialized. The only vulnerable thing in the fields was the zucchini, so those got covered up for the night.</p><p>Most of the things we&#x2019;re planting were started in the greenhouse last month. Radishes, beets, carrots, lettuce mixes, and a few other things are all that have been directly sown. The seeder is a mildly amusing little device that is filled with seed and run down the beds as its wheels churn and it digs a trench, meters out seed, fills the trench, and tamps it down. All of the rows I&#x2019;ve done are far from straight. Nobody else does much better, actually. The only reason it matters is that it stinks when a hoe wont fit between the two rows due to somebody&#x2019;s sloppy driving.</p><p><img src=/brian/img/2512786212.jpg alt="Visitor from Planet Rochester"></p><p>I had a visitor last weekend. Rachel came out from Rochester Thursday night via train. It was a rather nice visit, which we started out by hand-weeding a bed of mesclun mix. That took most of Friday actually. I milked Friday morning, just so my personal photographer could record the event and prove that I&#x2019;m on a farm and learning things.</p><p><img src=/brian/img/2511952085.jpg alt="Milking Bennie"></p><p><img src=/brian/img/2511954619.jpg alt="Milking Bennie"></p><p>We&#x2019;re finally settling into a semi-routine as far as moving all of the animals is concerned. We moved the chicken coop a few days ago, and for two or three days the hens weren&#x2019;t really able to find their way back at night. So that was a chore&#x2026; waiting until they were sleeping on a fence somewhere before grabbing them and putting them into the coop. That has finally stopped. The girl goats are being moved to new pasture every day&#x2026; boy goats every few days. The sheep are finally out for almost a week at a time. The oxen are chewing on possibly five days of pasture per move, but are still being punks and getting out of their fence too often. Time to up the voltage.</p><p><img src=/brian/img/2511955541.jpg alt=Crazyface></p><p>Oh! I almost forgot&#x2026; we got llamas last Sunday! Llamas have a funny looking name, and are funny looking creatures. Everything about them is weird and they scare me and they smell and I really really dislike them. Llamas sure do spit when agitated. And perhaps you think &#x201C;Gee Brian. Getting spit on isn&#x2019;t too terrible, is it?&#x201D;&#x2026; and I say yes. Yes it is, because this is llama spit and LLAMAS DON&#x2019;T BRUSH THEIR TEETH, OK? It is a foul substance that you could only simulate by fermenting the essence of dog breath with a touch of vomit and moldy sock.</p><p>I&#x2019;d have photos here of said llamas, but I really don&#x2019;t feel like getting my camera all smelled up. Maybe I&#x2019;ll risk it soon, just so you can see the freak show yourselves. Until then&#x2026; I require slumber.</p></section><footer><div class=left>&#x2190;&#xA0;<a href=/brian/2008/05/lawnmunchers>Before: Lawnmunchers</a></div><div class=right><a href=/brian/2008/05/first-market>After: First Market</a>&#xA0;&#x2192;</div></footer></article></div><script>window.ga=function(){ga.q.push(arguments)};ga.q=[];ga.l=+new Date;
