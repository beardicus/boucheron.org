	<section><p>Spring is long gone, yet we have some new babies on the farm, as of
yesterday. We&#8217;ve had some guinea fowl eggs stuck underneath a
broody hen (chicken) for what seems like months now (probably four
weeks really)&#8230; so I decided to poke around underneath her and see
if there was any activity. There&nbsp;was!</p>
<p><img alt="Guinea Hatch" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2650836611.jpg" /></p>
<p>As you may be able to see, I discovered a guinea chick peeping
around underneath the hen. Broody Hen (that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve taken to
calling her) quickly got used to everybody poking around underneath
her to get a look, and now doesn&#8217;t even peck at you as you root
around under her warm blobby broody body. The chicks are up and
about today, pecking at some mash and getting wee baby drinks of&nbsp;water.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s what passes for excitement around here. Entertainment,
really. I realize I may have spoken poorly of the guineas in the
past, but they&#8217;ve really grown on me this summer. They eat a lot of
ticks, and don&#8217;t eat the vegetables in the garden. They run much
faster and more elegantly than the fat chickens, have some level of
personality (mostly &#8220;stupid&#8221;), and roam far and wide on the
property, often stopping traffic in the road and exploring the
neighbor&#8217;s yards. Plus, they can actually fly a little bit, yet
choose to stick around and roost in our half-dead apple tree. How
sweet. So in summary, I&#8217;m happy we&#8217;re growing up two more, and I
hope they make it and I probably wont even try to slaughter them
and bring them back to Rochester in freezer&nbsp;bags.</p>
<p>In other news, we&#8217;re catching up with our weeding, sortof. It was a
long day in the tomato patch today, and my grab, twist, and pull
muscles are tired. I reserved enough strength to do the evening
milking, and now I get a rest. I suspect tomorrow will involve some
weeding of the melon beds. And the winter squash. And the corn. And
the pumpkins. Blah. It is rather hot and humid here, and today I
considered becoming one of those people who complains about the
weather (a retiree?)&#8230; but, anything under ninety and I refuse to
change out of my work pants and into shorts&#8230; so no bellyaching.
There was a nice breeze today, but apparently not at ground level.
The trees whooshed and swooshed, yet there was stillness down in
the weeds. Hot days make me wear sunscreen. Obviously that&#8217;s
stupid, as the quantity of solar radiation apparently has no
bearing on my application, just warmth. I guess it correlates
pretty well. I&#8217;m rather tanned, but still feel I could get pinky
after a long day in the&nbsp;sun.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m babbling. It is time to shut in the chickens and chicks, and
then head to bed. Much visitor preparation is needed tomorrow,
along with weeding and laundry and on and&nbsp;on.</p></section>
