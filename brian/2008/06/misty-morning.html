<p>It has been rather warm and moist here lately. I woke up today
(Sunday, my &#8220;day off&#8221;) at around five, with the sun peeking in the
hayloft doors (which are now permanently open to ventilate the goat
butt barn scent). I&#8217;m not sure what compelled me to bound out of
bed and take pictures. Perhaps my lack of doing so for the past two
weeks. Or perhaps because the sun had a particular hazy, diffuse
quality that I knew would be gone pretty&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>So off I went. It was my first t-shirt-only morning&#8230; plus muck
boots, dress pants, suspenders, and my camera bag. I guess I got
some ok&nbsp;shots.</p>
<p>Anyways, the point of all this was that it is rather pretty here,
I&#8217;ve found. Yesterday after the market I took some detours on my
bike ride back. Various dirt roads deep into dark dark woods
smelling slightly acidic and decayed. Some were shortcuts between
more civilized roads. Some went beyond my means of locomotion, with
steep descents that I didn&#8217;t feel like tackling in the opposite&nbsp;direction.</p>
<p>There were lots of&nbsp;hills.</p>
<p>It was all quiet and beautiful, with woods and cows and barns and
fields and streams and gardens and an old round brick schoolhouse
and a beehive on somebody&#8217;s porch roof (bearproofing, I suppose)
and hills and valleys and misty bits and clotheslines and nice
views and nice smells. I will have to do more exploring, at more
photogenic times of day and with my camera on&nbsp;board.</p>

<p>All this mist and haze is, unfortunately, because it is durn hot
here. Only low nineties really, but it doesn&#8217;t feel nice. We went
from steady rain and a flood warning Thursday night and Friday
morning (when I got soaked through my &#8220;rain suit&#8221; while moving the
sheep) to the nineties on Saturday, and through the next few days
it seems. Last night was quite interesting, clear skies overhead
and clouds with silent lightning off in the distance (I guess you
may call it heat lightning, but it&#8217;s really just a normal storm you
can&#8217;t hear due to distance or refraction of sound waves (says
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_lightning">the internets</a>), so let us just call it lightning,&nbsp;ok?).</p>
<p>In wildlife news, I saw a black bear a few nights ago, with two
cubs close behind. They were basically at the tree line you can see
in the pictures above&#8230; which is rather too close to where we have
the boy sheep currently. They freaked out a bit. Doggie inspection
revealed no bears in the woods shortly after I spotted them, so
maybe they were just passing through for a dip in the stream
(something that has crossed my mind&nbsp;recently).</p>
<p>Derek found the guinea hen&#8217;s nest, with something like twenty eggs
piled up in there. A few were placed underneath the broody chicken
hen in the coop, so we&#8217;ll see if anything hatches. I guess most
people will remove the eggs and store them until the hen is ready
to sit for a while&#8230; because they don&#8217;t start sitting until
they&#8217;ve got them all out. I guess that makes sense. I&#8217;ve taken to
liking the guineas, even though they&#8217;re obnoxiously loud. They
don&#8217;t eat the crops and keep me from getting ticks. They can stay
for&nbsp;now.</p></section>
