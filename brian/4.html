	<section><p>Today was a five layer day. Shirt, thermal, hoodie, jacket, rain
coat. It has turned back into spring here, after a few weeks of
too-soon summertime. Forties and rain all day long, which will be
good for whatever we&#8217;ve gotten in the ground so far (carrots,
beets, spinach, spicy mesclun mix, other things I&#8217;ve forgotten) and
especially for the pasture, which I&#8217;m excited to see green up and
get lush and yummy looking (for a ruminant anyways). I envision it
sucking up all this rain and preparing to burst forth at the
slightest hint of&nbsp;sunshine.</p>
<p>Pasture means we don&#8217;t have to feed hay twice a day, making chores
slightly quicker. For the past few weeks, chores have basically
involved bringing hay to all the animals (goats, yaks, oxen, sheep)
and making sure they have sufficient water. This happens around
seven in the morning and five in the evening. I&#8217;ve been getting the
hang of milking the goats as well, so I&#8217;m sure us interns will add
that to our routine pretty soon. It&#8217;s still new enough to be a fun
task, but already the cleanup portion of milking is a&nbsp;chore.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been lax in my photo-taking lately, thus this boring and
unadorned post. I hope to rectify this soon with some panoramic
shots I&#8217;m fiddling with. Some other day though, as it is now well
past my farmer bedtime. The rain just picked up a bit, and that is
my cue to fall asleep while listening to the gutters&nbsp;gurgle.</p></section>

	<section><p>It&#8217;s nine o&#8217;clock on a Sunday night, and I&#8217;m already considering
going to bed. This is sad not only because it&#8217;s so early, but also
because I did relatively little today. Morning and evening chores,
and that&#8217;s about it. I suppose I also rode my bike into town for
the first time, but that&#8217;s not <em>work</em>&nbsp;really.</p>
<p>It was, sadly enough, a challenge though. Two and a half miles to
Ashfield proper, quite a bit of that is hill, and I am definitely
out of shape. I&#8217;m thinking it will become a good Sunday routine:
write letters all morning, ride to town and mail them, pick up some
<a href="http://www.berkshirebrewingcompany.com/">beer</a>, eat a slice of pizza, zip down the other side of the hill
at dangerous speeds. By the end of the summer perhaps I&#8217;ll be used
to living in an area with actual elevation&nbsp;changes!</p>
<p><img alt="Spring Training" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2419279690.jpg" /></p>
<p>Speaking of out of shape&#8230; last week we put the boys to work for
the first time this spring. By &#8220;we&#8221; I mean &#8220;Derek&#8221;, because there&#8217;s
no way I&#8217;ll be driving the team anytime soon, if ever. They were
especially spunky this first time out, and there was lots of
yelling and wrassling and I almost had to make a call to see if my
car insurance covers oxen damage. Luckily they stopped inches short
of my bumper, but you quickly realize that if they don&#8217;t want to do
something, such as stop or go or turn or not gore you, there&#8217;s
really not much you can do about it. But they eventually got down
to it and dragged an old tractor tire around, filled with rocks.
They got tired pretty quick, but they&#8217;ll be whipped into shape soon&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>We also walked the yaks last week. That was quite the hoot. It&#8217;s
almost a good thing they&#8217;re so skittish and want to run away from
you, because I wouldn&#8217;t want them running at me. Walking the yaks
is much like walking a dog, only bigger and with horns. Once you
manage to grab one in its pen, you just clip on a leash and hold on
tight. They were pretty spunky too, as it was also their first time
out after the long winter. After a little while they settled down
and would walk by your side and heel pretty well without pulling at
the leash. I wish I had photos of that, but alas, I don&#8217;t have a
personal photographer around to take flattering pictures of me in
my new&nbsp;habitat.</p></section>

	<section><p><img alt="Moved In" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2409113908.jpg" /></p>
<p>I moved into the barn yesterday, despite nighttime temperatures
that are still dipping into the mid thirties. I couldn&#8217;t resist the
draw of having my own space, and of not sleeping on the living room
couch with the family hound dog every night. It is currently forty
degrees out though, and I&#8217;m huddled up in my tent writing this. The
tent smells like camping should smell, and for now it&#8217;s a pretty
novel experience and fun to sleep in. I&#8217;m sure that will wear off.
I was plenty warm last night though, and the animals in the barn
quiet down at night, although right now they&#8217;re making quite the
racket. I&#8217;m so tired once it gets dark that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d
notice either way. It&#8217;s amazing how natural it is to sync up with
the daylight hours when you remove most of the artificial lighting
and electronic stimulants in your&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>The past week has seen a variety of activities. A lot more planting
in the greenhouse. All the beds up both sides are planted with
spinach and salad mixes. The center is now packed with tables full
of seedlings, with more on the way as soon as we scrounge up more
table space (read: doors on sawhorses). Apparently we&#8217;ll be doing
weekly-or-so succession plantings of greens and such, so I&#8217;m really
interested in seeing how that is planned out and planted in order
to keep our <span class="caps">CSA</span> members&#8217; bags full every week. The garden at home
has lacked such a plan in the past,&nbsp;unfortunately.</p>
<p><img alt="Loft View" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2409319424.jpg" /></p>
<p>We also cut down some dead ash trees for greenhouse fuel. We go
through quite a bit of wood at night, especially since the
greenhouse doesn&#8217;t have its second insulating plastic layer
installed. I ran a chainsaw for the first time, not cutting down
the trees but chopping the eight foot sections down into
stove-sized pieces. And then it was chopping time of course. It had
been a while, but the ash split really easily and we quickly had
enough chopped to last us a few&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>Last weekend I didn&#8217;t know what to do with the slow days, so I
ended up puttering in the greenhouse. I&#8217;m glad I did, because I got
the beds fluffed up and dried out so we could plant earlier&#8230; but
this weekend I&#8217;m definitely more comfortable with just taking a
break. I&#8217;m looking forward to warm days off when I can go explore
the area on my bike. I hear there are waterfalls and wading pools&nbsp;nearby!</p></section>

<p>I have been reprimanded for not posting enough, and for not taking
enough pictures of baby animals. One of those &#8220;problems&#8221; is easy to
remedy. As you may be noticing, this post is awash in photographs
of cute baby sheep and goats and even a bad puppy.&nbsp;Enjoy!</p>

<p>As far as writing more, I suppose I&#8217;ll have to just write about the
minute doings of my current life. I guess maybe that&#8217;s interesting.
Today, I drove a tractor. A tractor with a bucket thingy and
separate pedals for forward and reverse, and separate left and
right brakes. It seems like a really good idea to me, to have four
pedals available for maximizing your messing up&nbsp;potential.</p>
<p>I used the tractor to do two things: After we mucked out all the
stalls this morning, I had to scrape the bedding away from the barn
and scoop it into the big steamy pile of cow goo. I feel like the
bucket control lever could have a much more intuitive interface
(perhaps a scroll wheel or a trackpad?) but I managed to get the
hang of it just fine. In the afternoon I had to take water up to
the oxen, who are out on pasture finally (they were very happy to
be out of the barn, and I wish I had shot video of the terrifying
sight of a 1600 pound oxen jumping and bucking with glee whilst
stumbling down the hillside towards the tiny yet apparently
effective portable electric fencing). This involves filling a basin
and toting it up the hill in the tractor&#8217;s bucket, whilst not
spilling too much. I got it all the way up the hill, and dropped it
as I was setting it down inside the fence. Round two was more
successful, with the boys receiving not only fifteen gallons of
water, but also their surprisingly heavy mineral block for licking&nbsp;upon.</p>
<p><img alt="Bad Dog" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2396852459.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Wee Goat" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2396850507.jpg" /></p>
<p>It only took two days for me to get zapped by the aforementioned
fencing. It felt similar to when I plugged in my Lite-Brite
incorrectly (read: while squeezing the prongs together to fit it in
the outlet), only this time no thoughts of turning into a robot
crossed my mind, and I find that terribly&nbsp;disappointing.</p></section>

	<section><p><img alt="The Barn++" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2386691326.jpg" /></p>
<p>Sorry for the delay&#8230; I arrived on the farm Tuesday and have been
rather busy since. I just got a chance to set up the internets last
night. I also haven&#8217;t taken a ton of photos yet, I feel like a
tourist boob whipping out my camera at every single interesting
thing. I&#8217;ve certainly missed a lot of cute baby photo-ops thus far
(cute animal babies, that is). Just yesterday there was some
feeding of a newborn lamb in the house next to the fire. It was the
only one of five to survive, so a sad morning, but happy that this
one pulled through and got up on its wobbly too-big legs and is now
back in the barn&nbsp;nursing.</p>
<p><img alt="A Field, Plus Jebedaiah" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2386687502.jpg" /></p>
<p>The area is beautiful, even when it&#8217;s all melty and muddy. Last
night we got a dusting of snow, so it&#8217;s back to a lovely winter
white, if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing. Personally, I&#8217;m rather
done with winter and am looking forward to seeing this place put on
some fuzzy green pantaloons. We were working in the greenhouse
yesterday, and will do so again today. It was one-hundred degrees
in there when we opened the doors&#8230; rather nice to work in short
sleeves and sweat a bit, although my back is sore from preparing
the beds for planting&nbsp;greens.</p>
<p>We have to feed the fire in the greenhouse a couple of times a
night, and my shifts are gradually getting later and later as I am
less and less the new guy. I hope the nights warm up soon, so we
can all get uninterrupted sleep again. Even with the slumbertime
chores I&#8217;m finding it pretty easy to get up around six or so. That
might be because things wind down here around ten and I find it
hard to stay up much later than that. Certainly is a schedule
shift, and I&#8217;m struggling to figure out how to separate free-time
from work-time and how to relax and also get other personal
projects done. Today we&#8217;re taking a wee break before going out to
work. Everybody is gone but Adam (the other intern) and&nbsp;I.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, it&#8217;s almost the top of the hour, time to check on the
soon-to-be-mother sheep and get down to work. Expect more bland
stories and flaccid insight in the weeks to&nbsp;come!</p></section>

	<section><p>As most of you know, I have left the lovely village of Rochester
for a few months, in order to more fully scratch an itch I&#8217;ve been
having regarding food and agriculture and ecology and so on. I&#8217;ll
be working on a wee family farm in Ashfield, Massachusetts until
mid-October. I am fully prepared for this to be a slightly
different work experience than my previous job as a chair-sloucher
and mouse-pusher, and am looking forward to that. I hope to
experience 110% more sunshine, 80% more animal dander, and 1254%
more plant matter than in previous&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>In order to more gently ease into the great outdoors, I went to
Mendon Ponds park on Sunday with some of my most special Rochester
friends. We experienced &#8220;nature&#8221; by walking through its
well-groomed paths and feeding the ferociously wild Chickadees out
of our bare hands. No doubt these skills will come in handy when
dealing with the various domesticated fowl on the&nbsp;farm.</p>

<p><img alt="Avian Adventure" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2376226798.jpg" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently at my parent&#8217;s house in Floyd, eating some niblets in
preparation for more travel. I&#8217;ve got about three hours of driving
left, hopefully with a stop in the middle to check out Troy and its
curious inhabitants. I&#8217;m not sure what to expect upon arrival
at <a href="http://sanghafarm.com/" title="The Sangha Farm Website">Sangha Farm</a> this afternoon. I visited them of course, and it
seemed really great. I&#8217;m just bracing for it to be a big change of
pace in so many ways. But, I&#8217;m excited and ready to get down to it.
Keep an eye out for a plentitude of photos and more blathering&#8230;&nbsp;soon!</p></section>
