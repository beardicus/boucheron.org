	<section><p><img alt="Cheese Updates" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/7030390405.jpg" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been making cheese a bit lately, and that&#8217;s somewhat interesting I think, so I decided to dust off the ol&#8217; blog and camera for proper documentation and dissemination. You can find more photos of the actual making of these cheeses at my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/sets/72157628911833001">cheesemaking photoset on Flickr</a>, and I promise to be more proactive next time I spend a Sunday in the kitchen, stirring&nbsp;curds.</p>
<p>First off, why the heck did I start making cheese at home? Who knows. I like to make things that have to age for years before I can eat or drink them, and I enjoy making foods that involve bacteria, fungi, or yeasts. I&#8217;m sure some of my interest was also stimulated by the summer I spent milking goats (check the scrollback for more on that). Any way you slice it, for some reason I bought a book called <a href="http://amzn.to/H8AvWQ"><em>Home Cheesemaking</em></a> by <a href="http://www.cheesemaking.com/">Ricki Carroll</a>, and I flipped through it really quick, and then it sat in the book pile next to my bed for about a year, slowly creeping its way towards the floor as other books became a higher&nbsp;priority.</p>
<p>I finally dusted it off this January and decided to make cheddar, and thus began three straight weekends of kitchen toil. I bought some rennet and cultures from <a href="http://www.cheesemaking.com/">Ricki Carroll&#8217;s site</a> (this reminds me, I <em>did</em> try making cheese a few years ago, using grocery store rennet, but it turned out pretty terrible, so I guess I purged it from memory). I then made a special trip to the public market, hoping to get some good milk from the Ithaca dairy guy that usually attends, but alas, he was not there. I was more successful at the <a href="http://www.abundance.coop/">hippy food co-op</a>, where I believe they carry the very same&nbsp;milk.</p>
<p>That was a Saturday morning. I then spent the rest of the day mentally preparing by reading and rereading the recipe (no, really (I do this a lot)), and gathering the equipment I&#8217;d need to perform this feat. The next day was a long day of cleaning the kitchen, cleaning it more, cleaning utensils and pots and pans, and then the precise heating of milk, along with additions of cultures and rennet and lots of waiting for said items to do their magic. I probably spent six or eight hours creating the cheddar. The other cheeses were easier and quicker. Again, next time I&#8217;ll document better and give you a bit more of a step by&nbsp;step.</p>
<p><img alt="The Cheese Cave" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/7030417163.jpg" /></p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the thousand foot overview. The next weekend I made parmesan. And after that, romano. I needed a place to age these. Above, you&#8217;ll see my kegerator, which was a free find on craigslist (woohoo!). Since I don&#8217;t make beer often enough anymore, the kegerator has turned into a trusty cheeserator (ahem: &#8220;cheese cave&#8221;), providing roughly the right environment for turning new cheese into old&nbsp;cheese.</p>
<p><img alt="The Cheese Cave, Interior" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/7030420739.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="The Cheese Cave, Interior" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/6884324862.jpg" /></p>
<p>With any luck, I&#8217;ll need more shelves in there soon, but for a quick retrofit it works pretty well. That&#8217;s a cutting board resting on top of some canning jars to keep it out of any moisture that might collect on the floor of the fridge. The thermostat on the fridge didn&#8217;t mind going up to fifty-five degrees, so I thankfully didn&#8217;t need to go get an external temperature controller ($$$). The humidity seems to want to be at 75% or so (that&#8217;d make a good humidor, I hear), so a pan of water or two does a good job of bringing it up to the 80&ndash;85% that I&#8217;m looking for. I&#8217;ve been running it a little dry lately to keep the mold at bay, but in doing so I&#8217;m risking some cracking of the&nbsp;cheeses.</p>
<p>Some day I&#8217;ll wire up a hygrometer and humidifier with some overengineered elctronics for more precise control over this particular variable. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll reflect upon some frequent advice from the homebrewing world: &#8220;relax, don&#8217;t worry, and have a homebrew&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll all work&nbsp;out.</p>
<p><img alt="Cheese Updates" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/7030365459.jpg" /></p>
<p>This is the parmesan, cheese #2. It&#8217;s about one and a half pounds, and two months old. In a few weeks, I&#8217;ll probably rub it with olive oil to keep the rind from cracking, or I might bag it up and vacuum seal it. I haven&#8217;t decided yet. I do like the idea of natural rinds, full of texture and mold and&nbsp;&#8220;character&#8221;. </p>
<p><img alt="Cheese Updates" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/7030380279.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Cheese Updates" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/6884298954.jpg" /></p>
<p>Romano! It had a bit more yield than the parmesan, probably two pounds. Of course it&#8217;s also softer/wetter, so I&#8217;m sure most of that is water weight. It&#8217;s drying and aging nicely. I could probably slice it up and eat it soft in a few months, but I&#8217;m planning to dry it right out for a nice grating&nbsp;cheese.</p>
<p><img alt="Cheese Updates" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/6884286378.jpg" /></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the first cheese I made&#8230; good ol&#8217; cheddar (obviously this one has been waxed, next time I may try a natural rind of some sort). There are many ways to take shortcuts making cheddar. They all involve trying to avoid the two or three hour process of cheddaring, which basically consists of holding slabs of curd at a specific temperature while they expel whey and acidify. The curds require some tending during the process, so it definitely made for a long day in the kitchen. But, I wanted to try the &#8220;real&#8221; way at least&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>So now I continue to wait for these cheeses to age. They&#8217;ll all be tasty around a year from now, but I might slip up and sample them a bit earlier. I guess that depends on if I get down to making some fresher, less aged cheeses to tide me over in the meantime. For obvious reasons, I&#8217;ve been searching around for a good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucheron">bucheron</a> cheese recipe for a while now. Bucheron is a ripened goat cheese. Basically a chevre with a bloomy (white mold) rind that you age for four weeks or so. It&#8217;s really really tasty (I&#8217;m so glad my namesake cheese is so yummy!). I finally found a recipe for it in the second cheese book I bought, <a href="http://amzn.to/HACpt9"><em>Artisan Cheesemaking at Home</em></a>. There&#8217;s actually lots of neat and creative recipes in there&#8230; cheeses you&#8217;ll not be finding in the grocery store any time soon, so stay tuned for updates on those (and if you&#8217;re in Rochester, or on my Christmas list, maybe you&#8217;ll even get to taste&nbsp;some)!</p></section>

	<section><p><img alt="Guinea Fowl, Two Weeks" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2704218284.jpg" /></p>
<p>Well. I find myself missing the above pictured critters, as well as
the goats, oxen, yaks, and farm folk. I left the farm mid-August,
in order to get home and take care of some pressing matters. I
guess things were getting pretty routine by that point anyway, and
it made me itch to get home and start doing something&#8230; finding
some land, developing some freelance work, learning some
newly-important life skills, working on some different farms. I&#8217;m
not sure what I&#8217;ll have to blabber about on the blog now, but you
should be warned that some of it will probably be 1000% more nerdy
than before. We&#8217;ll&nbsp;see.</p>
<p>Right after I got home, Rachel and I zipped off to Maine to laze
about for a week at her parents&#8217; place. That certainly delayed my
settling-in phase here in Rochester, but made for a great
transition between two very different worlds. I still get up fairly
early, but I am creeping later and later each day, and I stay up
too late. I&#8217;ll have to work on that, as I enjoy getting up at six
and having the quiet morning to myself. Also, it is odd to have too
much free time and too little hard labor. I&#8217;ve contacted some local
farms and hopefully will find a place I can visit and work at
between my job and freelance and other pursuits&#8230; the garden just
doesn&#8217;t cut&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><img alt="Birthday Cake Fire" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2810083764.jpg" /></p>
<p>We happened to be in Maine on my birthday, and Rachel <span class="amp">&amp;</span> her sister
made me a yummy farm-themed cake. They managed to cover all the
important animals from the farm, except the yaks. There was even a
team of appropriately colored oxen, munching on the coconut and
frosting &#8220;grass&#8221;. I managed to milk the birthday event for almost a
full week&#8230; eating too much, drinking vast quantities of yummy
beer, and lazing about reading books and taking naps.&nbsp;Whee!</p>
<p><img alt="Birthday Brace Balloon" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2809268799.jpg" /></p>
<p>But now it&#8217;s back to reality-land. First on the to-do list was to
set up an office here at Rachel&#8217;s place, which I guess is now &#8220;our
place&#8221;. Having done that I am now ready to dive into some freelance
work, and have indeed already talked to the bike shop and started
some materials for next year&#8217;s Tour de New York (the first, I
suppose). Soon I will return to my prior job part-time as well, and
also try to work in some internships, with any luck. So maybe there
will soon be more variety here, instead of all these tiresome
pictures of farm animals! Who&nbsp;knows!</p></section>

	<section><p><img alt="Visitor, From Another Planet" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2675697716.jpg" /></p>
<p>I had visitors last weekend. Somehow only one of them managed to
get photographed. Rachel drove to Rome, and hitched a ride the rest
of the way with my parents, who were on their way to Vermont to
meet up with other Volkswagen Bus weirdos. So they got in fairly
early on Friday, and we put her to work rather quickly after the
folks left. For some reason we were a little behind in the harvest.
Oh yeah&#8230; because a goat had a broken leg and there were vet
visits and such to worry about. So Rachel and I harvested together
whilst everybody else was off at the vet. We bunched up kale,
beets, carrots, and lots of herbs. Probably some other stuff I&#8217;ve
forgotten about as well. (Oh yeah! Two kinds of cucumbers and three&nbsp;squashies.)</p>
<p>So, it was nice to see her, and even though we couldn&#8217;t manage to
chit-chat while harvesting and counting bunches and such, it was a
nice plump weekend of activities. Too much walking to town and back
though&#8230; I was getting more tired on my days off than during the&nbsp;week.</p>
<p><img alt="Shelburne Falls Potholes" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2674880635.jpg" /></p>
<p>We took a short ride to Shelburne Falls, and wandered around there
like touristy folk. There is a bridge of flowers that we walked
along, with Rachel telling me what they all were and me forgetting
them promptly. It was quite lovely, and I managed to take zero
pictures. We got a frozen hot chocolate at a cafe, and it was
delicious and not at all like a chocolate milkshake thank&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>The parents came back Sunday evening, and we went out to dinner at
a local bar, of which I didn&#8217;t get the impression of &#8220;fine
eatery&#8221;&#8230; but it was really quite good. I made everybody eat some
mussels. And the desserts were fantastic looking, so we were all
fatty-fats and pigged out. Then we came back and drank some beer
and played&nbsp;pitch.</p>
<p><img alt="Garlic Buggie" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2674899563.jpg" /></p>
<p>And then, everybody left me on Monday. Poo. Then it was back to the
same old. Wednesday was a little different though&#8230; we harvested
all the garlic. Not sure how much, we never did end up counting
bulbs. It was about fifty pounds of seed garlic though. So we
pulled it all up, laid it out, filled up a cart, dragged it to the
barn, bunched it up, and hung it on strings. It was kindof my first
blister-causing activity. My hands are a mess, which made it hard
to weed and trellis tomatoes&nbsp;today.</p>
<p><img alt="Garlic Pile" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2674902803.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Garlic Harvest" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2675731830.jpg" /></p>
<p>It smells rather delicious walking through the barn now&#8230; and of
course I&#8217;m making some hilarious vampire&nbsp;jokes.</p>
<p><img alt="Guinea Fowl, One Week" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2674908369.jpg" /></p>
<p>The wee Guinea Fowl are one week closer to ugliness. Look at that
elongating neck! They&#8217;ve been moved inside with their surrogate
mother. Now they reside in an old playpen, and thankfully still
make only cute chick sounds. I anticipate they&#8217;ll be out and about
before they learn how to be more obnoxious. I wonder, will they act
somewhat more chickenish then the other Guineas? Will they all get
along? Probably not&#8230; they&#8217;re known for finding at least one of
their own to pick on and excommunicate. Heartless poultry. I think
I shall eat one of you after&nbsp;all.</p></section>

	<section><p>Spring is long gone, yet we have some new babies on the farm, as of
yesterday. We&#8217;ve had some guinea fowl eggs stuck underneath a
broody hen (chicken) for what seems like months now (probably four
weeks really)&#8230; so I decided to poke around underneath her and see
if there was any activity. There&nbsp;was!</p>
<p><img alt="Guinea Hatch" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2650836611.jpg" /></p>
<p>As you may be able to see, I discovered a guinea chick peeping
around underneath the hen. Broody Hen (that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve taken to
calling her) quickly got used to everybody poking around underneath
her to get a look, and now doesn&#8217;t even peck at you as you root
around under her warm blobby broody body. The chicks are up and
about today, pecking at some mash and getting wee baby drinks of&nbsp;water.</p>
<p><img alt="Guinea Daylings" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2653365479.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Guinea Daylings" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2654191132.jpg" /></p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what passes for excitement around here. Entertainment,
really. I realize I may have spoken poorly of the guineas in the
past, but they&#8217;ve really grown on me this summer. They eat a lot of
ticks, and don&#8217;t eat the vegetables in the garden. They run much
faster and more elegantly than the fat chickens, have some level of
personality (mostly &#8220;stupid&#8221;), and roam far and wide on the
property, often stopping traffic in the road and exploring the
neighbor&#8217;s yards. Plus, they can actually fly a little bit, yet
choose to stick around and roost in our half-dead apple tree. How
sweet. So in summary, I&#8217;m happy we&#8217;re growing up two more, and I
hope they make it and I probably wont even try to slaughter them
and bring them back to Rochester in freezer&nbsp;bags.</p>
<p>In other news, we&#8217;re catching up with our weeding, sortof. It was a
long day in the tomato patch today, and my grab, twist, and pull
muscles are tired. I reserved enough strength to do the evening
milking, and now I get a rest. I suspect tomorrow will involve some
weeding of the melon beds. And the winter squash. And the corn. And
the pumpkins. Blah. It is rather hot and humid here, and today I
considered becoming one of those people who complains about the
weather (a retiree?)&#8230; but, anything under ninety and I refuse to
change out of my work pants and into shorts&#8230; so no bellyaching.
There was a nice breeze today, but apparently not at ground level.
The trees whooshed and swooshed, yet there was stillness down in
the weeds. Hot days make me wear sunscreen. Obviously that&#8217;s
stupid, as the quantity of solar radiation apparently has no
bearing on my application, just warmth. I guess it correlates
pretty well. I&#8217;m rather tanned, but still feel I could get pinky
after a long day in the&nbsp;sun.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m babbling. It is time to shut in the chickens and chicks, and
then head to bed. Much visitor preparation is needed tomorrow,
along with weeding and laundry and on and&nbsp;on.</p></section>

<p>I suppose a little bit has happened since our last chat. There have
been a lot of harvests, a lot of markets, and a lot of weeding.
Blech. We&#8217;ve finally moved on from just greens, with some beets and
carrots and squash now showing up on our market tables. That feels
nice. I&#8217;m not sick of salads, but will enjoy the added variety&nbsp;nonetheless.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also blown through all of our garlic scapes in the past few
weeks. What a lovely product. Waste product is more like it, as we
would cut them off even if nobody were willing to buy them. But
people do, and as they should because it&#8217;s quite the nice delicate
garlic taste right when everybody&#8217;s garlic braids are running out
from the previous season. Soon we will start harvesting fresh
garlic for the <span class="caps">CSA</span>, and then I&#8217;ll get to see how we harvest and dry
the rest, and perhaps even try my hand at making some&nbsp;braids.</p>
<p>I had visitors, many weeks ago. My parents came out for a few days
in their Vanagon&#8230; and they dragged Rachel along for the ride. In
fact, they will be doing the very same thing next weekend on their
way to Vermont for some crazy Volkswagen meet-up they seem to be
attending&nbsp;yearly.</p>

<p>We went on a tour of the <a href="http://www.berkshirebrewingcompany.com/">Berkshire Brewing Company</a> while they
were in town. It was quite the nice tour, with an ample amount of
free tastings and an entertaining tour guide&#8230; rather in depth and&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>I think the folks had a good time here at the farm. They brought
plenty of beer and crackers and cheese and Rachel and I helped them
consume it whilst playing Pitch around the wee table in their
camper. Mom hopefully got enough pampering in, bringing fixings for
dinner and breakfast and also some cookies and the&nbsp;like.</p>

<p>We also went out to a flea market, which was not quite a bust, but
close. We showed up late due to poor directions, and it was a
semi-cloudy-rainy day anyways, so people were packing up and
heading home. I got a good camera tripod though, so that&#8217;s good.
And afterwards there happened to be a good brewpub on the way home,
so we stopped there for a late lunch. You can perhaps see a theme
developing&nbsp;here.</p>

<p>This past weekend I went to the Northeastern Permaculture
Convergence in Holyoke. I haven&#8217;t got the brain capacity right now
to explain what permaculture is&#8230; perhaps someday. But it&#8217;s
somewhat involved in designing agricultural systems, if you will.
Anyways, it was an interesting weekend, and I&#8217;m still processing
things in my head. I met Dave from Rochester there, who has
<a href="http://www.greenerminds.com/">a blog</a> I&#8217;ve been reading for a while now. So that made it
pretty worthwhile. We didn&#8217;t talk a ton, but he seemed great and
will no doubt be a valuable resource upon my return. He has some
connections within organizations I&#8217;m interested in, and also is
tinkering with his own permaculture garden/yard which I hope to
view&nbsp;someday.</p>
<p>I guess there were around 100 other people at the convergence. I
didn&#8217;t talk to many of them. I&#8217;m antisocial, and suck at events
such as this. But I did meet a lot of nice folks, and picked a few
brains. Mainly I enjoyed touring some farms, gardens, and
nurseries. Of course I didn&#8217;t write down the scores of cool plants
I saw, but I feel like I&#8217;m not at that stage yet, and have the
names of some books to obtain that should point out the highlights
at&nbsp;least.</p>

<p>So, it feels good to be back at the farm. Things were a little
weird when I got back, with the oxen getting out of their pasture
once again, apparently a problem all weekend. That&#8217;s pretty
frustrating. And there are many animals that need moving in the
morning, which I don&#8217;t entirely look forward to. But. Being away
made me appreciate many more things about this place, so I shall
not&nbsp;complain.</p></section>
