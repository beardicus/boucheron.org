	<section><p><img alt="Guinea Fowl, Two Weeks" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2704218284.jpg" /></p>
<p>Well. I find myself missing the above pictured critters, as well as
the goats, oxen, yaks, and farm folk. I left the farm mid-August,
in order to get home and take care of some pressing matters. I
guess things were getting pretty routine by that point anyway, and
it made me itch to get home and start doing something&#8230; finding
some land, developing some freelance work, learning some
newly-important life skills, working on some different farms. I&#8217;m
not sure what I&#8217;ll have to blabber about on the blog now, but you
should be warned that some of it will probably be 1000% more nerdy
than before. We&#8217;ll&nbsp;see.</p>
<p>Right after I got home, Rachel and I zipped off to Maine to laze
about for a week at her parents&#8217; place. That certainly delayed my
settling-in phase here in Rochester, but made for a great
transition between two very different worlds. I still get up fairly
early, but I am creeping later and later each day, and I stay up
too late. I&#8217;ll have to work on that, as I enjoy getting up at six
and having the quiet morning to myself. Also, it is odd to have too
much free time and too little hard labor. I&#8217;ve contacted some local
farms and hopefully will find a place I can visit and work at
between my job and freelance and other pursuits&#8230; the garden just
doesn&#8217;t cut&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><img alt="Birthday Cake Fire" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2810083764.jpg" /></p>
<p>We happened to be in Maine on my birthday, and Rachel <span class="amp">&amp;</span> her sister
made me a yummy farm-themed cake. They managed to cover all the
important animals from the farm, except the yaks. There was even a
team of appropriately colored oxen, munching on the coconut and
frosting &#8220;grass&#8221;. I managed to milk the birthday event for almost a
full week&#8230; eating too much, drinking vast quantities of yummy
beer, and lazing about reading books and taking naps.&nbsp;Whee!</p>
<p><img alt="Birthday Brace Balloon" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2809268799.jpg" /></p>
<p>But now it&#8217;s back to reality-land. First on the to-do list was to
set up an office here at Rachel&#8217;s place, which I guess is now &#8220;our
place&#8221;. Having done that I am now ready to dive into some freelance
work, and have indeed already talked to the bike shop and started
some materials for next year&#8217;s Tour de New York (the first, I
suppose). Soon I will return to my prior job part-time as well, and
also try to work in some internships, with any luck. So maybe there
will soon be more variety here, instead of all these tiresome
pictures of farm animals! Who&nbsp;knows!</p></section>

	<section><p><img alt="Visitor, From Another Planet" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2675697716.jpg" /></p>
<p>I had visitors last weekend. Somehow only one of them managed to
get photographed. Rachel drove to Rome, and hitched a ride the rest
of the way with my parents, who were on their way to Vermont to
meet up with other Volkswagen Bus weirdos. So they got in fairly
early on Friday, and we put her to work rather quickly after the
folks left. For some reason we were a little behind in the harvest.
Oh yeah&#8230; because a goat had a broken leg and there were vet
visits and such to worry about. So Rachel and I harvested together
whilst everybody else was off at the vet. We bunched up kale,
beets, carrots, and lots of herbs. Probably some other stuff I&#8217;ve
forgotten about as well. (Oh yeah! Two kinds of cucumbers and three&nbsp;squashies.)</p>
<p>So, it was nice to see her, and even though we couldn&#8217;t manage to
chit-chat while harvesting and counting bunches and such, it was a
nice plump weekend of activities. Too much walking to town and back
though&#8230; I was getting more tired on my days off than during the&nbsp;week.</p>
<p><img alt="Shelburne Falls Potholes" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2674880635.jpg" /></p>
<p>We took a short ride to Shelburne Falls, and wandered around there
like touristy folk. There is a bridge of flowers that we walked
along, with Rachel telling me what they all were and me forgetting
them promptly. It was quite lovely, and I managed to take zero
pictures. We got a frozen hot chocolate at a cafe, and it was
delicious and not at all like a chocolate milkshake thank&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>The parents came back Sunday evening, and we went out to dinner at
a local bar, of which I didn&#8217;t get the impression of &#8220;fine
eatery&#8221;&#8230; but it was really quite good. I made everybody eat some
mussels. And the desserts were fantastic looking, so we were all
fatty-fats and pigged out. Then we came back and drank some beer
and played&nbsp;pitch.</p>
<p><img alt="Garlic Buggie" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2674899563.jpg" /></p>
<p>And then, everybody left me on Monday. Poo. Then it was back to the
same old. Wednesday was a little different though&#8230; we harvested
all the garlic. Not sure how much, we never did end up counting
bulbs. It was about fifty pounds of seed garlic though. So we
pulled it all up, laid it out, filled up a cart, dragged it to the
barn, bunched it up, and hung it on strings. It was kindof my first
blister-causing activity. My hands are a mess, which made it hard
to weed and trellis tomatoes&nbsp;today.</p>
<p><img alt="Garlic Pile" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2674902803.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Garlic Harvest" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2675731830.jpg" /></p>
<p>It smells rather delicious walking through the barn now&#8230; and of
course I&#8217;m making some hilarious vampire&nbsp;jokes.</p>
<p><img alt="Guinea Fowl, One Week" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2674908369.jpg" /></p>
<p>The wee Guinea Fowl are one week closer to ugliness. Look at that
elongating neck! They&#8217;ve been moved inside with their surrogate
mother. Now they reside in an old playpen, and thankfully still
make only cute chick sounds. I anticipate they&#8217;ll be out and about
before they learn how to be more obnoxious. I wonder, will they act
somewhat more chickenish then the other Guineas? Will they all get
along? Probably not&#8230; they&#8217;re known for finding at least one of
their own to pick on and excommunicate. Heartless poultry. I think
I shall eat one of you after&nbsp;all.</p></section>

	<section><p>Spring is long gone, yet we have some new babies on the farm, as of
yesterday. We&#8217;ve had some guinea fowl eggs stuck underneath a
broody hen (chicken) for what seems like months now (probably four
weeks really)&#8230; so I decided to poke around underneath her and see
if there was any activity. There&nbsp;was!</p>
<p><img alt="Guinea Hatch" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2650836611.jpg" /></p>
<p>As you may be able to see, I discovered a guinea chick peeping
around underneath the hen. Broody Hen (that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve taken to
calling her) quickly got used to everybody poking around underneath
her to get a look, and now doesn&#8217;t even peck at you as you root
around under her warm blobby broody body. The chicks are up and
about today, pecking at some mash and getting wee baby drinks of&nbsp;water.</p>
<p><img alt="Guinea Daylings" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2653365479.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Guinea Daylings" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2654191132.jpg" /></p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what passes for excitement around here. Entertainment,
really. I realize I may have spoken poorly of the guineas in the
past, but they&#8217;ve really grown on me this summer. They eat a lot of
ticks, and don&#8217;t eat the vegetables in the garden. They run much
faster and more elegantly than the fat chickens, have some level of
personality (mostly &#8220;stupid&#8221;), and roam far and wide on the
property, often stopping traffic in the road and exploring the
neighbor&#8217;s yards. Plus, they can actually fly a little bit, yet
choose to stick around and roost in our half-dead apple tree. How
sweet. So in summary, I&#8217;m happy we&#8217;re growing up two more, and I
hope they make it and I probably wont even try to slaughter them
and bring them back to Rochester in freezer&nbsp;bags.</p>
<p>In other news, we&#8217;re catching up with our weeding, sortof. It was a
long day in the tomato patch today, and my grab, twist, and pull
muscles are tired. I reserved enough strength to do the evening
milking, and now I get a rest. I suspect tomorrow will involve some
weeding of the melon beds. And the winter squash. And the corn. And
the pumpkins. Blah. It is rather hot and humid here, and today I
considered becoming one of those people who complains about the
weather (a retiree?)&#8230; but, anything under ninety and I refuse to
change out of my work pants and into shorts&#8230; so no bellyaching.
There was a nice breeze today, but apparently not at ground level.
The trees whooshed and swooshed, yet there was stillness down in
the weeds. Hot days make me wear sunscreen. Obviously that&#8217;s
stupid, as the quantity of solar radiation apparently has no
bearing on my application, just warmth. I guess it correlates
pretty well. I&#8217;m rather tanned, but still feel I could get pinky
after a long day in the&nbsp;sun.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m babbling. It is time to shut in the chickens and chicks, and
then head to bed. Much visitor preparation is needed tomorrow,
along with weeding and laundry and on and&nbsp;on.</p></section>

<p>I suppose a little bit has happened since our last chat. There have
been a lot of harvests, a lot of markets, and a lot of weeding.
Blech. We&#8217;ve finally moved on from just greens, with some beets and
carrots and squash now showing up on our market tables. That feels
nice. I&#8217;m not sick of salads, but will enjoy the added variety&nbsp;nonetheless.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also blown through all of our garlic scapes in the past few
weeks. What a lovely product. Waste product is more like it, as we
would cut them off even if nobody were willing to buy them. But
people do, and as they should because it&#8217;s quite the nice delicate
garlic taste right when everybody&#8217;s garlic braids are running out
from the previous season. Soon we will start harvesting fresh
garlic for the <span class="caps">CSA</span>, and then I&#8217;ll get to see how we harvest and dry
the rest, and perhaps even try my hand at making some&nbsp;braids.</p>
<p>I had visitors, many weeks ago. My parents came out for a few days
in their Vanagon&#8230; and they dragged Rachel along for the ride. In
fact, they will be doing the very same thing next weekend on their
way to Vermont for some crazy Volkswagen meet-up they seem to be
attending&nbsp;yearly.</p>
<p><img alt="Grain Mill" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2586001266.jpg" /></p>

<p><img alt="Bottling" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2586089082.jpg" /></p>
<p>We went on a tour of the <a href="http://www.berkshirebrewingcompany.com/">Berkshire Brewing Company</a> while they
were in town. It was quite the nice tour, with an ample amount of
free tastings and an entertaining tour guide&#8230; rather in depth and&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>I think the folks had a good time here at the farm. They brought
plenty of beer and crackers and cheese and Rachel and I helped them
consume it whilst playing Pitch around the wee table in their
camper. Mom hopefully got enough pampering in, bringing fixings for
dinner and breakfast and also some cookies and the&nbsp;like.</p>
<p><img alt="Experimental Casks" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2587848450.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Tasting Room" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2585959648.jpg" /></p>
<p>We also went out to a flea market, which was not quite a bust, but
close. We showed up late due to poor directions, and it was a
semi-cloudy-rainy day anyways, so people were packing up and
heading home. I got a good camera tripod though, so that&#8217;s good.
And afterwards there happened to be a good brewpub on the way home,
so we stopped there for a late lunch. You can perhaps see a theme
developing&nbsp;here.</p>

<p><img alt="Northeastern Permaculture Convergence, Summer 2008" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2643951042.jpg" /></p>
<p>This past weekend I went to the Northeastern Permaculture
Convergence in Holyoke. I haven&#8217;t got the brain capacity right now
to explain what permaculture is&#8230; perhaps someday. But it&#8217;s
somewhat involved in designing agricultural systems, if you will.
Anyways, it was an interesting weekend, and I&#8217;m still processing
things in my head. I met Dave from Rochester there, who has
<a href="http://www.greenerminds.com/">a blog</a> I&#8217;ve been reading for a while now. So that made it
pretty worthwhile. We didn&#8217;t talk a ton, but he seemed great and
will no doubt be a valuable resource upon my return. He has some
connections within organizations I&#8217;m interested in, and also is
tinkering with his own permaculture garden/yard which I hope to
view&nbsp;someday.</p>
<p>I guess there were around 100 other people at the convergence. I
didn&#8217;t talk to many of them. I&#8217;m antisocial, and suck at events
such as this. But I did meet a lot of nice folks, and picked a few
brains. Mainly I enjoyed touring some farms, gardens, and
nurseries. Of course I didn&#8217;t write down the scores of cool plants
I saw, but I feel like I&#8217;m not at that stage yet, and have the
names of some books to obtain that should point out the highlights
at&nbsp;least.</p>
<p><img alt="Northeastern Permaculture Convergence, Summer 2008" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2643162131.jpg" /></p>

<p><img alt="Northeastern Permaculture Convergence, Summer 2008" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2643180909.jpg" /></p>
<p>So, it feels good to be back at the farm. Things were a little
weird when I got back, with the oxen getting out of their pasture
once again, apparently a problem all weekend. That&#8217;s pretty
frustrating. And there are many animals that need moving in the
morning, which I don&#8217;t entirely look forward to. But. Being away
made me appreciate many more things about this place, so I shall
not&nbsp;complain.</p></section>

	<section><p><img alt="Good Morning Farm" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2562453316.jpg" /></p>
<p>It has been rather warm and moist here lately. I woke up today
(Sunday, my &#8220;day off&#8221;) at around five, with the sun peeking in the
hayloft doors (which are now permanently open to ventilate the goat
butt barn scent). I&#8217;m not sure what compelled me to bound out of
bed and take pictures. Perhaps my lack of doing so for the past two
weeks. Or perhaps because the sun had a particular hazy, diffuse
quality that I knew would be gone pretty&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>So off I went. It was my first t-shirt-only morning&#8230; plus muck
boots, dress pants, suspenders, and my camera bag. I guess I got
some ok&nbsp;shots.</p>
<p>Anyways, the point of all this was that it is rather pretty here,
I&#8217;ve found. Yesterday after the market I took some detours on my
bike ride back. Various dirt roads deep into dark dark woods
smelling slightly acidic and decayed. Some were shortcuts between
more civilized roads. Some went beyond my means of locomotion, with
steep descents that I didn&#8217;t feel like tackling in the opposite&nbsp;direction.</p>
<p>There were lots of&nbsp;hills.</p>
<p>It was all quiet and beautiful, with woods and cows and barns and
fields and streams and gardens and an old round brick schoolhouse
and a beehive on somebody&#8217;s porch roof (bearproofing, I suppose)
and hills and valleys and misty bits and clotheslines and nice
views and nice smells. I will have to do more exploring, at more
photogenic times of day and with my camera on&nbsp;board.</p>
<p><img alt="Good Morning Farm" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2561639437.jpg" /></p>
<p>All this mist and haze is, unfortunately, because it is durn hot
here. Only low nineties really, but it doesn&#8217;t feel nice. We went
from steady rain and a flood warning Thursday night and Friday
morning (when I got soaked through my &#8220;rain suit&#8221; while moving the
sheep) to the nineties on Saturday, and through the next few days
it seems. Last night was quite interesting, clear skies overhead
and clouds with silent lightning off in the distance (I guess you
may call it heat lightning, but it&#8217;s really just a normal storm you
can&#8217;t hear due to distance or refraction of sound waves (says
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_lightning">the internets</a>), so let us just call it lightning,&nbsp;ok?).</p>
<p>In wildlife news, I saw a black bear a few nights ago, with two
cubs close behind. They were basically at the tree line you can see
in the pictures above&#8230; which is rather too close to where we have
the boy sheep currently. They freaked out a bit. Doggie inspection
revealed no bears in the woods shortly after I spotted them, so
maybe they were just passing through for a dip in the stream
(something that has crossed my mind&nbsp;recently).</p>
<p>Derek found the guinea hen&#8217;s nest, with something like twenty eggs
piled up in there. A few were placed underneath the broody chicken
hen in the coop, so we&#8217;ll see if anything hatches. I guess most
people will remove the eggs and store them until the hen is ready
to sit for a while&#8230; because they don&#8217;t start sitting until
they&#8217;ve got them all out. I guess that makes sense. I&#8217;ve taken to
liking the guineas, even though they&#8217;re obnoxiously loud. They
don&#8217;t eat the crops and keep me from getting ticks. They can stay
for&nbsp;now.</p></section>
