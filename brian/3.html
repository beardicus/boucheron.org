	<section><p><img alt="Harvest" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2519267024.jpg" /></p>
<p>Last Friday was our first harvest day, in preparation for the
Ashfield Farmer&#8217;s Market Saturday morning. It was pretty exciting
to finally be able to snip some edible bits off of some of the
plants we&#8217;ve been staring at for more than a month now. We mostly
had salad mix and spinach from the beds in the greenhouse. I
remember preparing some of those beds my first weekend here, back
in April. It feels like everything is growing sooooo slooooowly,
but I think I just have unrealistic expectations. It sure is nice
though, to sit up in the barn loft and look at the fields, with
rows upon rows of thin green lines (some red and purple)&#8230; I can&#8217;t
wait until they&#8217;re all thick green&nbsp;lines.</p>
<p><img alt="Trimmings" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2519274634.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Harvest" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2519271560.jpg" /></p>
<p>We also pulled up some onions that had overwintered in the field
across the road. Their existence wasn&#8217;t really intentional: it was
a bed that had been lost to weeds last year and mowed down to
nothing before winter. But they came back, and upon pulling them up
they had some nice white bulbs attached. So we made up about 35
bunches of those, which involved cleaning off the gunky layers,
snipping the roots, bunching them up, and washing them off in a
bucket. A lot of labor, but worth it because nobody else had fresh
onions at the market. Rounding out the selection was bunches of
chives, a few bunches of tarragon, and that&#8217;s it. All of this was
packed up and ready for the <span class="caps">CSA</span> members to pick up at the market.
We don&#8217;t divvy things out into boxes and drop them off anywhere,
instead our members get a canvas bag with a pretty Sangha Farm logo
on it, and they just come to the market and fill it up. It
certainly makes things easier on us, and I think is good for the
customer, as they can pick and choose only the things they want
(although there is something to be said for being forced to try the
new fruits and vegetables you find in your <span class="caps">CSA</span>&nbsp;share).</p>

<p><img alt="Ashfield Farmer's Market" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2519161331.jpg" /></p>
<p>In addition to our meager selection of produce, we had a ton of
vegetable starts to bring to the market. The van was quite full,
with multiple tiers of precariously stacked flats of delicate
plants. Luckily the market is only about one mile away. We got
there at seven and were just finishing setup by eight thirty when
the market opens. As of right now us interns don&#8217;t really have to
work the market, so after hanging around and helping out a little
bit, I wandered off and sat under a tree to write letters. It was a
beautiful day, and tons of people came out. The market is much
smaller than Rochester&#8217;s main public market, and much more social.
In the center of all the tents was a constant four hour meeting of
neighbors and friends (and dogs). A man in a bowler hat and bow tie
came and played cello for a bit. Another man brought two tiny
donkeys and walked them around while being followed by eager
donkey-petters (they were amazingly soft (the&nbsp;donkeys)).</p>
<p>After writing letters for a while, I wandered to the post office
and the hardware store, and got back in time to see the ice cream
truck pull up in front of the town green where the market is held.
It&#8217;s an old converted school bus, out of which is served locally
made organic ice cream. Of course I had to sample some, and indeed
the butter pecan was quite&nbsp;delicious.</p>
<p>Ooh! I forgot about the cheese. We finally got our license to make
and sell cheese. What an amazingly bureaucratic process that is.
I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t even really hear about half of it, but from what
I did hear it&#8217;s no wonder there are very few small-time dairies&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>But, we made it through all the hoops, and Maribeth cranked out as
much cheese as possible before the market. She had a sample tray
all set up and received many complements and sold out of everything
she made. That means there will be two more does joining us, and
the two does with kids still nursing will be separated at night so
we can steal the morning milk at least. More milk! Unfamiliar
teats!&nbsp;Yikes!</p>

	<section><p>Ack! It&#8217;s already Wednesday night and I haven&#8217;t written about last
week or this past weekend even! Even now, at nine o&#8217;clock, I feel
bad because my typing is probably keeping Adam up, and really I
would enjoy sleeping very much. We&#8217;ve shifted our schedule around,
so now I&#8217;m getting up at five thirty, eating breakfast and
attempting to slowly start the day, and then out and working by
seven. I guess that&#8217;s not crazy early. It feels it though,
especially when you have to milk in the evening and aren&#8217;t really
done working until eight thirty. I&#8217;ve taken to making lunch a quick
sandwich, so that I can sneak off and catch a little nap before we
get back to&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been planting like mad for the past week, and all of this
week. Onions onions onions leeks cabbage cabbage cabbage broccoli
and other stuff I readily forget. We had a little frost scare a few
nights ago, but it never materialized. The only vulnerable thing in
the fields was the zucchini, so those got covered up for the&nbsp;night.</p>
<p>Most of the things we&#8217;re planting were started in the greenhouse
last month. Radishes, beets, carrots, lettuce mixes, and a few
other things are all that have been directly sown. The seeder is a
mildly amusing little device that is filled with seed and run down
the beds as its wheels churn and it digs a trench, meters out seed,
fills the trench, and tamps it down. All of the rows I&#8217;ve done are
far from straight. Nobody else does much better, actually. The only
reason it matters is that it stinks when a hoe wont fit between the
two rows due to somebody&#8217;s sloppy&nbsp;driving.</p>
<p><img alt="Visitor from Planet Rochester" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2512786212.jpg" /></p>
<p>I had a visitor last weekend. Rachel came out from Rochester
Thursday night via train. It was a rather nice visit, which we
started out by hand-weeding a bed of mesclun mix. That took most of
Friday actually. I milked Friday morning, just so my personal
photographer could record the event and prove that I&#8217;m on a farm
and learning&nbsp;things.</p>
<p><img alt="Milking Bennie" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2511952085.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Milking Bennie" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2511954619.jpg" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;re finally settling into a semi-routine as far as moving all of
the animals is concerned. We moved the chicken coop a few days ago,
and for two or three days the hens weren&#8217;t really able to find
their way back at night. So that was a chore&#8230; waiting until they
were sleeping on a fence somewhere before grabbing them and putting
them into the coop. That has finally stopped. The girl goats are
being moved to new pasture every day&#8230; boy goats every few days.
The sheep are finally out for almost a week at a time. The oxen are
chewing on possibly five days of pasture per move, but are still
being punks and getting out of their fence too often. Time to up
the&nbsp;voltage.</p>
<p><img alt="Crazyface" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2511955541.jpg" /></p>
<p>Oh! I almost forgot&#8230; we got llamas last Sunday! Llamas have a
funny looking name, and are funny looking creatures. Everything
about them is weird and they scare me and they smell and I really
really dislike them. Llamas sure do spit when agitated. And perhaps
you think &#8220;Gee Brian. Getting spit on isn&#8217;t too terrible, is
it?&#8221;&#8230; and I say yes. Yes it is, because this is llama spit and
<span class="caps">LLAMAS</span> <span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;T <span class="caps">BRUSH</span> <span class="caps">THEIR</span> <span class="caps">TEETH</span>, <span class="caps">OK</span>? It is a foul substance that you
could only simulate by fermenting the essence of dog breath with a
touch of vomit and moldy&nbsp;sock.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d have photos here of said llamas, but I really don&#8217;t feel like
getting my camera all smelled up. Maybe I&#8217;ll risk it soon, just so
you can see the freak show yourselves. Until then&#8230; I require&nbsp;slumber.</p></section>

	<section><p><img alt="Goat Runway" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2483367411.jpg" /></p>
<p>Back when I was a youngster, I was forced to spend many hours upon
a tractor, mowing acres upon acres of foolish lawn, huffing exhaust
and damaging my hearing all the while (thanks parents!). As I sat
on my buttocks for extended periods of time, I would often set my
mind to thinking upon different fantastical technologies one could
use to trim grass with less pain and more ease. Most of what I came
up with was nebulously defined at best, but it usually involved
laser&nbsp;beams.</p>
<p>Yes indeed. Obviously laser beams would, at the push of a button
(perhaps after turning a key or some other nuclear launch button
safety device), shoot out over your lawn at the specified height,
neatly snipping the tips of every blade in sight, perhaps even
incinerating the trimmings (if you&#8217;re the bag-em-up type). I
envisioned this system as one you would install once, with the
beams and mirrors placed in all the right spots to get behind every
tree and down into every contour of the lawn. Ever afterwards, your
juvenile life would be free of toil and full of recreation and&nbsp;joy.</p>
<p><img alt="BioLawnmower Results" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2483363581.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am now reminded of this technology every time we move the animals
and their portable electric fences. They each have their own
munching styles, but in general the combination of energized fences
and hungry hungry animals ensures a laser-like cut of grass&#8230;
every single blade right up to the fence line. When I move fence I
feel like I am setting up my childhood Lazer-Mow system, defining
the boundaries and coordinates within which the grass shall be
trimmed to my specifications. Up and down hills, over gullies,
around trees and rocks. Nothing fazes the herbivorous lawnmowing&nbsp;machine.</p>
<p><img alt="BioLawnmower Results" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2484174606.jpg" /></p>
<p>Best of all, it&#8217;s also fertilizing the soil, reseeding the pasture,
generating meat or milk or wool or oxen-power, the only noise is
some cute bleating or the occasional moo, and it&#8217;s much less
odiferous than a tractor. It feels like a much better use of
technology, to gently guide nature with some solar powered fence
chargers and a roll of fence, instead of trying to dominate it
completely with hundreds of pounds of iron and gasoline and hours
of someone&#8217;s precious&nbsp;time.</p></section>

	<section><p><img alt="Farm Invasion" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2460798294.jpg" /></p>
<p>I seem to keep getting yelled at for my blog inaction. I guess my
five readers are desperate for farm-based updates. This past
weekend was a rainy and semi-lazy one. It actually started on
Thursday with a rainy and cold day, which kept us inside for most
everything but the chores. It felt like a weird day of waiting to
work but not doing anything, and I got a little screwed up. It
really wasn&#8217;t a day off in my brain, but I tried to make that
mental transition, knowing that we&#8217;d have to make up time on
Saturday or&nbsp;Sunday.</p>
<p><img alt="Farm Invasion" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2460803400.jpg" /></p>
<p>Friday was equally cold and rainy. We had a mob of children come
visit the farm, which was&#8230; entertaining. I took some photos and
then ran and hid in the barn. They appeared to enjoy seeing all of
the animals and petting lambs and whatnot. If I recall my
field-trip days though, they were probably just happy to be
outside, roughhousing and doing nothing&nbsp;constructive.</p>
<p>Saturday and Sunday continued the trend of cold and rain. We moved
animals on Sunday, just so we could say we got some durn work done
for once. Oh, and also because the oxen kept getting out of their
fence, due to the fact that they had eaten up all their pasture,
and oh look, there&#8217;s green grass right over&nbsp;there!</p>
<p>Oh! So that&#8217;s a good story, I suppose. One of the goats was due to
kid on Friday. So after the kids (human) all left and Derek and
Maribeth left the farm to go do something, I go outside to check on
the goat and make sure there&#8217;s no signs of labor yet. But there was
a rather prominent sign, that being a baby goat on the ground,
covered in goo. Yikes! So I ran inside to tell Adam (the other
intern) and we went out and started pretending to know what we were
doing. Meanwhile Gregory from up the hill pulls into the driveway,
honking and carrying on. This is when we were notified that the
oxen were out and heading towards the garden.&nbsp;(!)</p>
<p>So somehow it was decided that Adam would take care of the
midwifery and I would go pretend to be a teamster and get the oxen
back where they belong. I ran and got their leads and lickin&#8217; stick
and set off hoping for the best. I guess it&#8217;d be a better story if
there was any difficulty, but it was really absurdly easy. I&#8217;m not
sure if they&#8217;re like dogs, in that you have to sound dominant or
wrassle them and win before they listen to you&#8230; but once I got
their leads on (which is really the hardest part, but a bowl of
grain helps keep them from running away) they seemed to accept fate
and do as they were told. Luckily, I had just worked out a mnemonic
to remember the commands&#8230; gee, haw, hip, woah are the basics. Gee
means go right, and I remember that because it sounds like &#8220;get&#8221; in
the redneck accent used to yell at Rachel&#8217;s dogs, and since you
lead from the left it works out, spatially speaking. Haw is for
going left, and it reminds me of southpaw, so that&#8217;s pretty easy.
Hip is the opposite of woah, and if you don&#8217;t know woah then you&#8217;ve
never had your mom pour milk for&nbsp;you.</p>

<p><img alt="Guinea Egg Study" src="http://boucheron.org/brian/images/2459974583.jpg" /></p>
<p>Also, I found a Guinea egg over the weekend. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guineafowl">Guinea Fowl</a> are
terrible poultry-like-objects that I&#8217;ve probably complained about
before. They make lots of noise and seem even dumber than chickens.
They hang out in the yak pen alot, and indeed that is where I found
the farm&#8217;s first Guinea Fowl egg. It&#8217;s a bit squatter and smaller
than your normal chicken egg, with a rougher shell. I failed to
photograph it whilst frying, but it had a larger yolk than one
would expect, with very little white. The yolk was very orange,
almost reddish inside, no doubt from all the god-knows-what they&#8217;re
eating out on the farm every&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>It tasted like any ol&#8217; egg. I found two more yesterday, and ate
those&nbsp;too.</p></section>

	<section><p>Today was a five layer day. Shirt, thermal, hoodie, jacket, rain
coat. It has turned back into spring here, after a few weeks of
too-soon summertime. Forties and rain all day long, which will be
good for whatever we&#8217;ve gotten in the ground so far (carrots,
beets, spinach, spicy mesclun mix, other things I&#8217;ve forgotten) and
especially for the pasture, which I&#8217;m excited to see green up and
get lush and yummy looking (for a ruminant anyways). I envision it
sucking up all this rain and preparing to burst forth at the
slightest hint of&nbsp;sunshine.</p>
<p>Pasture means we don&#8217;t have to feed hay twice a day, making chores
slightly quicker. For the past few weeks, chores have basically
involved bringing hay to all the animals (goats, yaks, oxen, sheep)
and making sure they have sufficient water. This happens around
seven in the morning and five in the evening. I&#8217;ve been getting the
hang of milking the goats as well, so I&#8217;m sure us interns will add
that to our routine pretty soon. It&#8217;s still new enough to be a fun
task, but already the cleanup portion of milking is a&nbsp;chore.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been lax in my photo-taking lately, thus this boring and
unadorned post. I hope to rectify this soon with some panoramic
shots I&#8217;m fiddling with. Some other day though, as it is now well
past my farmer bedtime. The rain just picked up a bit, and that is
my cue to fall asleep while listening to the gutters&nbsp;gurgle.</p></section>
