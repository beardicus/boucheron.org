I&#x2019;ve already tasted or given away half the wheel, and the initial reviews are quite positive. I&#x2019;m pretty happy with it myself. It tastes good, but maybe not perfect. Given that I was worried about it being a soaking moldy rancid mess when I finally cracked it open, I&#x2019;m feeling pretty accomplished. It&#x2019;s a bit moist&#x2013;creamy even&#x2013;and somewhat mild at this point in time (it&#x2019;s about eight months old). It doesn&#x2019;t seem to be oversalted. The curd is really well knit, with no gaps or crevices. It tastes a bit like a colby to me, so I have to figure out what the similarity is there.</p><p><img src=/brian/img/7819974674.jpg alt="First Cheddar Tasting"></p><p>I cut the wheel up into eights and vacuum packed them all. Hopefully I&#x2019;ll be able to wait out the full year before tasting the rest, and we&#x2019;ll see if it changes much in that time. In the meantime, the weather is getting nice and cool, and I&#x2019;m finding myself in the kitchen more often on the weekends, cooking and baking and brewing. Hopefully the cheesemaking will resume in October, and I&#x2019;ll be able to put up enough cheese over winter to satisfy the snacking appetite of family and friends for the next year.</p><p><img src=/brian/img/7820045254.jpg alt="First Cheddar Tasting"></p></section><footer><div class=left>&#x2190;&#xA0;<a href=/brian/2012/05/three-cheese-update>Before: Three Cheese Update</a></div><div class=right><a href=/brian/2015/06/test>After: Testing Foo</a>&#xA0;&#x2192;</div></footer></article></div><script>window.ga=function(){ga.q.push(arguments)};ga.q=[];ga.l=+new Date;
